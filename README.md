This To-Do List Application is a user-friendly web-based tool designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. The application features a clean and interactive interface with a purple-themed background, offering a visually appealing experience. Users can perform CRUD operations: create, read, update, and delete tasks. A text input field allows users to add new tasks, which are dynamically displayed in a list format. Each task has dedicated "Edit" and "Delete" buttons to modify or remove tasks effortlessly.
The application leverages localStorage to ensure task persistence across sessions, allowing users to retain their to-do list even after closing the browser. The task list is rendered dynamically using JavaScript, providing real-time updates as users add, edit, or delete tasks. The design includes a responsive layout, intuitive controls, and smooth transitions, making it a practical tool for daily task management.
